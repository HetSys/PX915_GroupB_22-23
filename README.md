# SPAMS - Single PArticle Model Solver

A half single particle model by Group B for the 2023 PX915 group project.

SPAMS models the charging and discharging of a lithium ion battery using a Crank-Nicolson semi-implicit finite difference scheme to obtain the
concentration of lithium in a sphere, **c**(i<sub>app</sub>, **r**), at each time step. 

## Program Features

Very short summary of what program can do...

## Running the program

Run line: ```python3 user_input.py```

## Accessing the user documentation

A full tutorial for basic usage of the program is provided in Jupyter notebook format.
*The notebook can been found in the Documentation folder (called 'Tutorial.ipynb)
*The notebook can be viewed here in github as a markdown file.
*Alternatively, the notebook can be loaded from the terminal by navigating to the Documentation directory and using the command:
```bash
nohup jupyter notebook Tutorial.ipynb
```

## Developer documentation

Developer documentation will be available via a link once I work out the whole github.io thing....
