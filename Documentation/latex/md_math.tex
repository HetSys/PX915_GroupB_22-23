A Crank-\/\-Nicolson semi-\/implicit finite difference scheme is used to obtain concentration of lithium in the sphere, c(iapp, r), at each time step by approximating the partial differential equation (P\-D\-E) solution.

This is accurate to second order both spatially and temporally, i.\-e. O(∆r2) \& O(∆t2).

S\-P\-A\-M\-S models the charging and discharging of a lithium ion battery using a Crank-\/\-Nicolson semi-\/implicit finite difference scheme to obtain the concentration of lithium in a sphere, {\bfseries c}(i$_{\mbox{app}}$ , {\bfseries r}), at each time step, and has the following features\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Apply a constant, stepwise or custom current
\item Options for parallelism
\item Extend the model to a full battery
\item First order sensitivty analysis
